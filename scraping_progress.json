My experience spans technology, consumer goods, automotive, and manufacturing, and I\u2019ve led regional and global teams through complex transformations, growth initiatives, and operational reinvention.\n\nWhat defines my path is not just advising on strategy, but owning it, leading from within, with full accountability for results. I\u2019ve run business units, shaped go-to-market models, built pricing and monetization frameworks, and improved commercial governance to help companies grow smarter and scale sustainably.\n\nToday at Salesforce, I lead Strategic Business Practices for the Americas. My focus is on enabling scalable, high-impact deal strategy across fast-paced, high-growth markets. I work closely with sales, finance, legal, and operations to make complex deals simpler, faster, and more profitable and to ensure our pricing models and governance structures support long-term value, not just short-term wins.\n\nThroughout my career, I\u2019ve helped global organizations unlock margin, expand regionally, and lead cross-functional transformations. I know how to navigate ambiguity, build alignment across diverse stakeholders, and turn competing interests into common purpose. Whether in boardrooms, frontline operations, or cross-border initiatives, I\u2019m drawn to complexity and to making it actionable.\n\nBut beyond strategy and execution, I care deeply about how we lead. As a woman who has thrived in industries and environments that weren\u2019t always designed to support equity, I understand the cost of success when cultures are misaligned. That\u2019s why I work to create healthier leadership models, ones that allow women to grow without burning out, and where diversity is not just welcomed, but recognized as essential to performance. Through my advisory work with the Women Economic Forum, I help elevate diverse voices in leadership and push for the cultural shifts that organizations need to stay relevant and human.\n\nI believe in business as a platform to create both value and change and I\u2019m always open to connecting with others who share that mindset.\n\nLet\u2019s talk if you\u2019re building something bold, evolving how your company sells or operates, or just looking to bring more clarity to complexity.\n\u2026see more",
